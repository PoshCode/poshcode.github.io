Although PowerShell provides an enormous benefit even when your scripts interact only with the local system, working with data sources from the Internet opens exciting and unique opportunities. Through its cmdlets and access to the networking support in the .NET Framework, PowerShell provides ample opportunities for Internet-enabled administration. In this session, we'll walk through some examples of using PowerShell to get a deeper understanding of the language your computer speaks when it talks to another computer. Along the way, we'll parse and download information from websites, interact with arbitrary TCP streams, and have some fun with network packet captures.
