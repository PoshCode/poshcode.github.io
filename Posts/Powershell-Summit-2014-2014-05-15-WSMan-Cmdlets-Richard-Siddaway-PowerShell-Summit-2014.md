PowerShell functionality is becoming increasingly broad. As the breadth of functionality increases there are pockets of useful functionality that get over looked.  The WSMAN cmdlets are one such pocket. You can utilise the WS-Management layer (WSMAN) directly to access a remote machine. They aren't a replacement for PowerShell remoting or CIM sessions but complement both of these technologies and supply an alternative access method. This session will examine how you can use these cmdlets -- where they are useful and where you should use other remote access methods.
