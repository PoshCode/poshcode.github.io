The introduction of the CIM cmdlets and "cmdlets over objects" in PowerShell v3 provide new ways to work with WMI. In addition, they bring a new way to access remote systems ? CIM sessions. Analogous to PowerShell remoting sessions they provide a new flexibility when working with WMI and remote machines. This session will demonstrate: How to use CIM sessions against systems running PowerShell v3; How to work with legacy installations of PowerShell v2; How to use the available CIM session options to configure the session to meet your requirements; Compare and contrast working with WMI, CIM and WSMAN cmdlets against remote machines to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each; and how to mix and match CIM sessions using WSMAN and DCOM. The key takeaways from this session will be: the CIM cmdlets provide a new way to access WMI; WSMAN is required knowledge; WSMAN and DCOM can both be used with the CIM cmdlets; CIM sessions are easy to use and very powerful; and no more DCOM problems

I have been working with Microsoft technologies for over 25 years having spent time in most IT roles including analyst-programmer, server administration, support, DBA and architect. I have been interested in automation techniques (including automating job creation and submission on mainframes many years ago!). I have been using VBScript and WMI since it became available on NT 4. PowerShell caught my interest when I first heard about it and I have been using it since the early beta versions. My blog is mainly about PowerShell. I founded the UK PowerShell user Group in 2007 and I am a PowerShell MVP. I have given numerous talks on PowerShell at various events in the UK, Europe and the USA. I am a frequent speaker for PowerShell user groups worldwide. I have had a number of articles on PowerShell published including expert commentaries on the Microsoft Scripting Games for which I have been a judge for the last three years. I have written two PowerShell books: PowerShell in Practice (Manning 2010) and PowerShell and WMI (Manning 2012) and coauthored PowerShell in Depth (Manning 2013). I am currently writing an introductory book for Active Directory administrators that features PowerShell.
