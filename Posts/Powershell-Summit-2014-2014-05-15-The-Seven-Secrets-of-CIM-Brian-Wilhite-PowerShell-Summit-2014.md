Windows PowerShell and WMI are a match made in Redmond... Seriously, these two "Power" houses are spectacular, awe-inspiring, breathtaking and amazing when fused together.  This coming April 28th, Windows PowerShell fiends, myself included, will descend upon the Meydenbauer Center in Bellevue, WA with a mouthwatering appetite for some PowerShell goodness, gluten free.  To satisfy that hardy hunger, come to my session where you'll discover "The Seven Secrets of CIM".  It's sure to be a PowerShell blast, you will walk away with real world knowledge that you can start practicing immediately.
