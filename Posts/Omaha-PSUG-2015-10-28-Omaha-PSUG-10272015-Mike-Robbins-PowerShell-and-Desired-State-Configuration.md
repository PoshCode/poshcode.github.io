PowerShell MVP Mike Robbins joins us live from Mississippi to talk about Using PowerShell Desired State Configuration in your On-Premises Datacenter.

In this day and age, with the virtualization of servers causing systems in your datacenter to multiply faster than a speeding bullet, how do you perform configuration management on all of those systems and the software that they run while operating on a shoestring budget? How do you detect and remediate configuration drift to stay in compliance with your organization’s standards? During this session, PowerShell MVP Mike F Robbins will demonstrate how DSC (Desired State Configuration) can be used to perform configuration management of the systems in your on-premises datacenter to include writing configurations, applying configurations via push and pull mode, and we’ll have a quick discussion about DSC resources. This is a beginner level DSC session, but prior experience with PowerShell is recommended.

He is a co-author of Windows PowerShell TFM 4th Edition and is a contributing author of a chapter in the PowerShell Deep Dives book. Mike has written guest blog articles for the Hey, Scripting Guy!
