PowerShell has allowed DBAs to manage huge numbers of SQL servers, all
automatically. Now BI practitioners can reap the same benefits of scale and
automation. Scenarios that are normally extremely time consuming can be done
quickly, all with a few lines of PowerShell.
This session will be filled with demos based on real-life scenarios and use-cases.
We will demonstrate how to scale and automate your BI solutions, with a
minimum of effort. In particular, we will be covering PowerShell cmdlets & their
integrations with SSRS, SSIS, & SSAS.
By the end of the session, you’ll be able to accomplish in minutes what would
normally take hours or days. You’ll know ways to quickly deploy hundreds of
SSRS objects to multiple servers; or instantly identify and process stale SSAS
dimensions. Additionally, you will also be able to take care of some pesky ETL
tasks, some by automating SSIS, and others using just plain old PowerShell.
