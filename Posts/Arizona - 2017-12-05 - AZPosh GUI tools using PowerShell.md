Presenter(s): During this session we will explore how to create a GUI interface to enhance scripts to become true tools that can be used by non-technical resources.
We will explore using some free tools and some almost free options.
At the conclusion of this session users will have an understanding of form properties and actions and how they relate to PowerShell code.
Attendees are encouraged to bring a thumb drive for sharing of sample code.
