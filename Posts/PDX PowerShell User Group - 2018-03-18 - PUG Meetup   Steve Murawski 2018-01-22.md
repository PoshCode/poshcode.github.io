Title:
Slow is Smooth
Smooth is fast

Abstract:
Looking for a place to get started with some DevOps practices? Already trying some tooling and not seeing the return you expected? Then, my friend, it’s time we had a chat about pipelines. Now, CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous delivery) pipelines aren’t necessarily the first thing operations teams look for when attempting to tackle a problem or implement a solution. And I’ve heard many of the arguments – with the chief of those being, “I’m not some startup. We don’t deploy changes tens or hundreds of times a day. We deploy every 4 months and we like it (or at least that’s what we have to like contractually).” While that may be true, my guess that your environment changes a bit more than that and the changes that happen outside those well-defined maintenance windows is what ends up causing most of our pain. Adding a pipeline to control the delivery of change forces us to slow down and think about the types of changes we make and how to automate and validate them. Once we’ve done that, making these changes becomes easier and easier. My firearms instructor from the police science program (years ago) had a saying which captures this, “Slow is Smooth, and Smooth is Fast”. By making our change process smooth, we put ourselves in a place where we can consistently deliver change on demand. CI/CD is about speed and readiness, not only about volume. Join me for a chat about why building a pipeline for infrastructure changes, especially in slow environments, is both possible and extremely rewarding. We’ll also look at some tooling to help make standing up those pipelines easy enough that we can try it over a lunch break.
