Puppet is a Configuration Management System framework from PuppetLabs that originated on Linux systems and has been ported to Windows in recent years. While some of the core library of Puppet’s configuration resource types are intended to be cross-platform, there are many extended configuration item requirements specific to Windows that are best solved using native Windows tools. In this presentation, we’ll explore the application of several PowerShell tools, techniques and patterns that help better integrate the power and maturity of Puppet on the Windows Platform.

Jim Ficarra is a Principal Engineer in the Operations Architecture Team for Comcast Cable’s Application Platform Services Group. The team’s responsibilities include application infrastructure design for performance & scalability, automation, and operational excellence.
