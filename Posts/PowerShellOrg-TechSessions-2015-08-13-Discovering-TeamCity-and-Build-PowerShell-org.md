Introduction to using TeamCity for continuous integration, with particular focus on how we’ve set up build.powershell.org for testing of PowerShell modules:

    Basics of TeamCity.  (How to set up a project.  Deeper understanding

    of how our templates and agents work.  How to expand on what’s already

    there once your project is created from the template.)
    GitHub integration.  (Build status icons automatically shown on GitHub branches and pull requests.)
    REST API basics.  (Build status icons on arbitrary websites or in README.md files, etc.)
    A look at how the Pester project uses TeamCity to automatically publish its releases to PowerShellGet, Chocolatey and nuget.org.
    Whatever else I think of over the next month, and can fit into the webinar
