PowerShell Web Access is a new feature in Windows Server 2012 that provides a web based PowerShell console. You don't need PowerShell on your client to administer remote machines as long as you have PWA. This session will demonstrate how to configure PWA, its strengths and weaknesses -- you might even see PowerShell being accessed from a non-Windows machine! The security implications of PWA will be discussed. PWA will be compared to other ways to access remote machines through PowerShell including PS Remoting and CIM sessions.

I have been working with Microsoft technologies for over 25 years having spent time in most IT roles including analyst-programmer, server administration, support, DBA and architect. I have been interested in automation techniques (including automating job creation and submission on mainframes many years ago!). I have been using VBScript and WMI since it became available on NT 4. PowerShell caught my interest when I first heard about it and I have been using it since the early beta versions. My blog is mainly about PowerShell. I founded the UK PowerShell user Group in 2007 and I am a PowerShell MVP. I have given numerous talks on PowerShell at various events in the UK, Europe and the USA. I am a frequent speaker for PowerShell user groups worldwide. I have had a number of articles on PowerShell published including expert commentaries on the Microsoft Scripting Games for which I have been a judge for the last three years. I have written two PowerShell books: PowerShell in Practice (Manning 2010) and PowerShell and WMI (Manning 2012) and coauthored PowerShell in Depth (Manning 2013). I am currently writing an introductory book for Active Directory administrators that features PowerShell.
