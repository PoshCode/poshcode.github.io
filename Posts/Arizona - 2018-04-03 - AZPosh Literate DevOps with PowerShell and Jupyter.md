Presenter(s): *Joel “Jaykul” Bennett:* 
With a brief overview of Donald Knuth’s decades old concept of literate programming, we’ll get an introduction to it’s modern application to DevOps. Learn how you can create programs, deployment scripts, and automation tools with significantly better documentation by changing your attitude toward the construction of programs: concentrate on explaining to human beings what you want the computer to do. We’ll also look at some related tools, like Binder, Jupyter Hubs and Labs, nteract and Hydrogen, with Atom.
