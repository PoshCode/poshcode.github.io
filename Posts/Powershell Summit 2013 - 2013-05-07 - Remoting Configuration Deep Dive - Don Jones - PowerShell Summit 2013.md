What do you do when Enable-PSRemoting isn't enough? Dig deeper. We'll run through all of the major configuration scenarios, including how to use (and not abuse) TrustedHosts, how to set up an HTTPS listener (and use it), how to do non-domain authentication, how to enable CredSSP and configure it to be less than a major security hole, and more. Pretty much every possible Remoting config, we'll cover. With detailed, step-by-step instructions!
