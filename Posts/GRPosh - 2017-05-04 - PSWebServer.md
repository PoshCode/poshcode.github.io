This is our first attempt at recording our presentations, and I now realize, I need to focus more on the screen, rather then the speaker.  Maybe next time...

You can find all of Micah Rairdon's (@tiberriver256) code snippets on our GRPosh GitHub Presentation Repo (https://github.com/GRPosh/Presentations).  And the PSWebServer module can currently be found here: https://gist.github.com/Tiberriver256/868226421866ccebd2310f1073dd1a1e
