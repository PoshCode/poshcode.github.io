Giving everyone, local administrator or domain administrator privileges is a really bad idea. Even the best of admins makes mistakes which can have unexpected consequences. With JEA we can truly follow the model of least privilege access giving admins the rights they need to do their job. 
No matter how big or small your environment is, giving every administrator unnecessary elevated privileges can result in data loss, or theft due to mistakes or rogue administration. Now with Just Enough Administration (JEA) we can truly follow the model of least privilege access and give admins, helpdesk technicians, developers (the list goes on) the rights they need to do their job, without bugging you, but still maintaining security best practices. 
We will not only go over how to configure JEA but will also show you how to properly configure and deploy it to an already existing infrastructure (without using DSC) but using remote PowerShell commands and GPO’s
