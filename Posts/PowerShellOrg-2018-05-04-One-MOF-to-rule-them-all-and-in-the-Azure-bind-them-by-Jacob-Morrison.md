DSC is typically node specific. This talk explores a case example where both standard and custom DSC resources will be leveraged to break out of managing many MOF files or partial DSC configurations. One MOF in Azure can be used to dynamically configure all devices throughout your environment.

Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a powerful DevOps tool enabling you to provide a consistent, standardized configuration throughout your environment.  On its own DSC has a narrow focus on individual target nodes requiring you to author many Management Object Format (MOF) files, or get creative with partial DSC configurations.  This talk aims to strip back some of the mystery of DSC and explore a case example where we’ll leverage both standard and custom DSC resources to create one “smart” MOF capable of dynamically evaluating devices throughout your environment, and configuring them appropriately.  We’ll tie all of this into Azure Automation to show you how you can leverage its capability to rapidly create new devices and ensure their standardization moving forward.
