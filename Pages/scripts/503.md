# Get-ServiceAccounts

### [download](//scripts/503.ps1) - [parent](//scripts/502.md)

Script will help discover any service accounts that are currently being used.  I have been using this script for about a month in production.  While your mileage may vary this script is strictly read only, thus -confirm, and -whatif are not supported.  

V.1	Initial Build
V.1.1	Optimized GWMI query
V.1.2	Added logic to record the cause of a failed query

#Author:     Glenn Sizemore glnsize@get-admin.com
#Purpose:    Scan a remote system for any services running under a non standard account.
#            Standard accounts would be considered, NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService, 
#            NT AUTHORITY\LocalService, LocalSystem, or .\ASPNET
#            
#Usage:      PS > Get-ServiceAccounts [-Target <string>] [-Path <string>] [-verbose] [-Credential <PSCredential Object> ]
#            
#            -Target(optional)  
#                  can be either a string or an array of strings.
#            -Path(optional)    
#                 Path to an item containing a list of Targets
#            -Verbose(optional) 
#                 turns on verbose logging to the console
#            -Credential(optional) 
#                  should only be used with V2, uses alternate credentials when 
#                querying target for services.
#
#Returns:    PSCustom Object
#
#Example:    Get-ServiceAccounts -Target "host1","host2","host3" -Path "C:\temp\otherhosts.txt" -verbose
#            
#            this command will combined the targets: host1, host2, and host3 with all targets located in 
#            the file otherhost.txt, and scan all of them for unique service accounts.
