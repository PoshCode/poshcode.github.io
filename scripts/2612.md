# ConvertTo-ASCII

### [download](2612.ps1) - children: [2613](2613.md)"

Here is a quick script I created to convert files to ASCII character set. This came about because I found Out-File was creating files as Unicode and Add-Content was writing ASCII (Even though the help says it defaults to Unicode). So writing to the files with Add-Content would use the wrong encoding and add garbage to the log files. I changed all my code to include the -Encoding ASCII parameter, but had thousands of files encoded as Unicode. (Note: To see what format it is, open in Notepad and select Save As... it will be listed at the bottom). It replaces the file with a new ASCII encoded file so I also added some logic to capture and set the original file timestamps. This is my first draft so I'm sure there is room for improvements. Such as error handling and adjustments so the input parameters don't have to be so exact, but it works and thought I would share. -=Levon

.SYNOPSIS
	Automation script for file character set format convertion to ASCII encoding.
.DESCRIPTION
	Script for automating the convertion of files to ASCII format.  Good for if you've used Out-File without specifying the
	encoding. Which would make a Unicode formatted file by default.  If you then used Add-Content to append data to that
	file it would have garbage characters because even though it states it defaults to Unicode it will write ASCII/ANSI.
.INPUTS
	Full Path to files to convert.
.OUTPUTS
	Replacement files in ASCII format.

.EXAMPLE
	.\ConvertTo-Ascii -path "C:\Folder1\Folder2\*" -include "*.txt"
	Will convert all of the files with a TXT file extension in the directory named Folder2.
.EXAMPLE
	.\ConvertTo-Ascii -path "C:\Folder1\Folder2\*" -include "filename.txt"
	Will convert a single file named filename.txt in the directory named Folder2
.EXAMPLE
	.\ConvertTo-Ascii -path "C:\Folder1\Folder2\*" -include "*.txt" -recursive $true
	Will convert all of the files with a TXT file extension in the directory named Folder2 and any subdirectories.
.EXAMPLE
	.\ConvertTo-Ascii -path "C:\Folder1\Folder2\*" -include "filename.txt" -recursive $true
	Will convert a single file named filename.txt in the directory named Folder2 and any subdirectories.
.PARAMETER path
	Full path to file/s to process. Standard wild cards are excepted. Be sure to put in quotation marks.
	It should work without a trailing backslash or asterisk, but it's recommended to simply include.
	See examples
.PARAMETER include
	Filename filtering opiton. Standard wild cards are excepted. Be sure to put in quotation marks.
.PARAMETER recursive
	Specifies if the script should look in subfolders off the path provided. Default is False (Do not do recursive).
	Use -recursive $true to enable.
