### [download](3154.ps1)"

Pings a host until it responds, tries to connect to the RDP port, and then when that succeeds, launches a remote desktop connection via mstsc.exe. I discuss this version here http://www.justaprogrammer.net/2012/01/07/making-an-rdp-connection-to-a-server-you-just-rebooted-with-powershell/
