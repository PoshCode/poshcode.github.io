This is script will first ask for a computername and then will scan the Win32_UserProfile WMI class and present the user with all of the possible user profiles to remove. After the profile has been deleted, the user has a choice to continue to remove another profile or quit. This script will only work against Vista and above client OS's and Window 2008 and above server OS's, but can be ran from any OS that has PowerShell installed. Updated to include Windows 10 and Server 2016.
