This script is a proof of concept. Further work needs to be done.  It requires the user to enter a valid username and password for a gmail.com account.  It then attempts to form an SSL connection with the server, and, retrieve the first email. Unfortunately it returns random results.  Perhaps someone can improve upon it with some more sockets knowledge than I have.

		requires the user to enter a valid username and password for a gmail.com

		someone can improve upon it.
